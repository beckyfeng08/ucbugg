HEADING LARGE: RENDER SETTINGS

Here is a quick breakdown on the different render settings you can play around with. Go to "RenderMan >> Advanced RenderMan Controls"

HEADING MEDIUM: COMMON RENDERMAN SETTINGS

<li> 1. First, you want to make sure your image format is set to OpenEXR. Then, you should set your Frame/Animation ext to "name#.ext" so that you can render out more than one frame. Frame padding should be 4. </li>
<li> 2. Set your frame range to what you want to render out. </li>
<li> 3. Make sure you have the camera you want to render in renderable cameras. If you are using Tractor and you have more than one renderable camera, Tractor will render out a frame for each camera, so you should click the little trash button for each camera you do not want to render. If you are using Google Cloud, the option for camera in the Zync settings will only show whatever cameras you have here for renderable camera so it is alright to have more than one renderable camera. </li>
<li> 4. If you are rendering the final short, make sure your image size is set to HD 1080. If you are not rendering your final short, you can use HD720 or HD540 to submit some tests. </li>

HEADING MEDIUM: SAMPLING AND DENOISING

For sampling, everyone's shorts will probably have different values. Submit some test renders to figure out what the best sampling rate for your short is. Start at 16 samples, then go up by a factor of 2 (so 32, 64, 128 etc) until you render out something that looks like good enough quality. 16 or 32 samples should be good enough for most of you, especially if you turn on denoising in the features tab as shown below. Note that if you have denoising turned on, you will have two frames rendered out. One of the images will have "_filtered" appended to the end of the file name, and that will be the denoised image. It won't add to your render time so you should definitely make sure you have it set.

HEADING LARGE: RENDERING USING TRACTOR

HEADING MEDIUM: SETTING UP TRACTOR ON THE LAB MACHINES

Unfortunately, using Tractor on the lab machines causes some security issues for the department. So, in order to use Tractor, there are a couple steps you need to do first so that everyone can use the render farm without any security issues. 

<b>NOTE:</b> These steps require you to use the terminal. I will try to lay them out as clearly as I can but please do not hesitate to ask a facilitator for help. Don't worry about how many steps there are, this should only take a couple of minutes. 

<b>STEP 1:</b> Quit Maya. You cannot have any instances of Maya open while you set up. 

<b>STEP 2:</b> Create a tmp directory for your account. To create your own  tmp directory, please login to
        http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/webacct, click on the
        'Account Details' or 'More' buttons, and then on
        'Make /home/tmp Directory' on the next page.

<b>STEP 3:</b> Open the terminal (type terminal into the search bar). Type 'chmod 755 /home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT' then press enter

<b>STEP 4:</b> Go to your newly created directory by typing 'cd /home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT'. 

<b>STEP 5:</b> Create a new directory for tractor by typing 'mkdir tractor' then pressing enter. 

<b>STEP 6:</b> Type 'chmod 777 tractor' then press enter. 

<b>STEP 7:</b> Copy your project files to the tractor directory. To access this directory from Finder, open up Finder, press CMD + SHIFT + G and type '/home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT'. Make sure your project has it's own folder within tractor.

<b>STEP 8:</b> Once your files have been transfered, go back to the terminal. If you have not quit out of the terminal and the terminal is still where it was during step 6, type 'cd tractor'. If you have quit out of the terminal, type 'cd home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT/tractor'

<b>STEP 9:</b> Type each of the following commands in seperately. 
<li> a. "find . -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;" </li>
<li> b. "find . -type f -exec chmod 666 {} \;" </li>

<b>STEP 10:</b> Type 'umask 000' then press enter. 

<b>STEP 11:</b> Now you can reopen Maya. However, you must open it via the terminal in order for the permission settings we've changed above to work. This is why it was important to not have any Maya instances open before. To open Maya via the terminal, type "/Applications/Autodesk/maya2017/Maya.app/Contents/bin/maya" then press enter. 

There you go! Tractor should now be working. Submit a test job of 5 frames to be sure. 

NOTE: If you close the terminal, you lose the permisson settings (umask) that you just set. So, if you ever close the terminal but need to submit another job, you need to "cd /home/tmp/YOUR_ACCOUNT/tractor" then repeat steps 10 and 11 again. 

HEADING MEDIUM: SUBMITTING A JOB TO TRACTOR

Reminder that you must open up Maya via the terminal as described in the section above for Tractor to work. If you do not, your job will fail at pre-flight.

To keep Tractor well organized, we ask that you name the scene as follows. This way you can easily see which scene is rendering on the Tractor screen.
GROUPNAME - SCENE X OF TOTAL - DESCRIPTION
ie: BANDITS - SCENE 8 of 21 - BREAKING VASE

Once you have done some test renders on the computer that you are using, you have figured out your optimal settings, and you want to push out some final frames for your animation, you are ready to use the fully operational power of the mac lab (hopefully, fingers crossed). If you need to speed up your render and separate the shadows (ask your facilitator if this is the case) read RENDERING SHADOWS SEPARATELY first before you submit your render to Tractor.

Make sure to set your projects to the correct folder (File >> Set Project). Double check to make sure your rendering settings are configured correctly. Go to Renderman Globals (first button on the Renderman bar) and change the settings accordingly. Remember, you should output .EXR images at HD720 with sampling at some value between 16-32. 

Now you can start batch rendering. Go to the Renderman --> Batch Render [option box]. In the dialog that pops up, make sure the appropriate options are selected:

You can watch the progress of your render job in realtime at http://york.cs.berkeley.edu/tv/. Simply enter your username, no password needed. Your files should be saved out in the /renderman/ folder within your project. There may be multiple subfolders within this one, sort them by 'Date modified' and you should be able to find the folder than Renderman most recently generated.

HEADING LARGE: RENDERING USING GOOGLE CLOUD

HEADING MEDIUM: SETTING UP GOOGLE CLOUD

If you want/need more rendering power, you can use Zync Render, which is on Google Cloud. This is a more convenient option over tractor, but there are many issues that may also come with this. 

HEADING SMALL: SETTING UP A ZYNC ACCOUNT THROUGH THE SCHOOL

Once you have your render settings set up, please call over a facilitator to make sure that everything looks correct to check you off. They will ask you for your @berkeley.edu e-mail to give you access to the Zync render farm.

<b>STEP 1:</b> Download the Zync client app and the Zync plugin from <a href='https://www.zyncrender.com/downloads/'>here</a>

<b>STEP 2:</b> Start the Zync client app. Click on “Connection Settings” and under Zync Site Address, enter <i>https://instzync1.zync.io</i>. Click “Login With Google” and sign in with your Calnet account (your @berkeley.edu account). This should take you to a page where you need to authorize Zync to access a few things. Afterwards, your window should look like this:

<b>STEP 3:</b> Start Maya. If Maya was already opened when you were downloading the client and plugin, please restart the program.

HEADING MEDIUM: SUBMITTING A JOB TO GOOGLE CLOUD

Note: Make sure you don't have any whitespaces in your path. If you do, the render will fail. Name your scenes by the following convention:
<b>GROUPNAME_SCENE#OF#_DESCRIPTION</b>, i.e. “THEONLYSTAR_SCENE2OF17_LOOKINGATSKY” instead of “THE ONLY STAR - SCENE 2 OF 17 - LOOKING AT SKY”

<b>STEP 1:</b> Open up the Zync client app. Open up the file you would like to render. Make sure all of your render settings are correct (You can edit these under RenderMan >> Advanced RenderMan Controls). Under the Zync tab in your menu bar in Maya, click on the Zync logo. In both the client app and the Zync Submit window, make sure to log in to your google account that you previously registered with. 
zync1.png

<b>STEP 2: </b> There are a variety of settings you can play around with in the Zync Submit window. Below, I will list the settings that I have changed from default or I think are important to note. 
zync2.png
	<li> a. <b>Num. Machines</b> refers to the number of computers you will have rendering at the same time. You can put any number you like here, but 50 is the max you can use at once. </li>
	<li> b. <b>Machine Type</b> is the kind of computer you will use. In the screenshot above, I have it set to the cheapest option, which is the PREEMPTIBLE 16GB one. </li>
	<li> c. Make sure you check <b>“Ignore Missing Plugin Errors”</b>. Maya has some weird problems sometimes so this will help us avoid those. </li>
	<li> d. <b>Project folder</b> and <b>output directory</b> show where it is taking all the files from as well as where it will send the renders. Make sure that there is no whitespace in either of these, otherwise your render might fail. Don't just change the name in this line though. You have to actually change the file path. </li>
	<li> e. <b>Renderer</b> should be set to Renderman. </li>
	<li> f. <b>Frame range</b> should carry over from your render settings but it's still good to double check that you are rendering the correct frames. </li>
	<li> g. <b>Chunk size</b> refers to how many frames Zync will give one machine. You should set this to 1 to get more done in less time. </li>
	<li> h. If you have more render layers than default, select them here. Otherwise, just select <b>“defaultRenderLayer”</b>. </li>
	<li> i. Your <b>resolution</b> should also carry through from your render settings. For your final short, you should be rendering in 1920x1080 (Full HD) but other resolutions are fine for testing purposes. </li>

<b><i>IMPORTANT! IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME SUBMITTING A JOB, PLEASE CALL OVER A FACILITATOR TO CHECK OVER YOUR RENDER SETTINGS BEFORE YOU CONTINUE!!</b></i>

<b> STEP 3: </b> Hit "Launch Job". Go to your zync website to watch the progress of your renders. They should auto-download once they're done but you shouldn't turn off your computer while it is going, otherwise the files might not get downloaded.  

HEADING SMALL: SETTING UP YOUR OWN ZYNC RENDERING ACCOUNT

Note: Only set this up if you are in desperate need for more renders. Otherwise, the school accounts and tractor should be enough to render your short.
Please make sure to follow these instructions in the order they are given. Zync is still in beta and if you do this out of order, your project may not get set up correctly and you won't be able to render. 

<b>STEP 1: </b> Go to <a href='https://console.cloud.google.com'> Google Cloud Console </a>. There should be a button on the top right that says "Sign up for free trial" and follow the next instructions. At some point in this registration, it'll ask for your credit card. Don't worry, google cloud isn't like all those other websites that require credit cards and it won't charge you when your trial is over. 

<b>STEP 2: </b> Now go to <a href='https://zyncrender.com'> Zync's website </a> and click register. Create a website (you can name it anything you want) and put in whatever you like for "Your Company Name". Click Next, and then wait for the email confirming your registration. 

<b>STEP 3: </b> Next, click on "Downloads" (or alternatively, <a href ='https://www.zyncrender.com/downloads/'>click here</a>). Download both the client app and the plugin for your OS. Follow the installation instructions for both. 

<b>STEP 4: </b> Open up the client app. Now go to your zync website and login. If you don't have any red bars going across the bottom, you are all set. If you do, click on the bar and follow the instructions to solve the problem. 

HEADING LARGE: RENDERING SHADOWS SEPARATELY
Note that you should only do this if your render is really slow. Also, this works best if the camera is still.

Before you start, render the background without visibility of anything that moves (put all characters/moving objects in separate layer) and render ONE frame of this. Do not send this one frame to tractor. It should render fine on the mac you are using or your laptop by itself.

1. Select object you want shadows on
2. Click the holdout button in the renderman tab
3. Make sure only "shadows" is checked
4. Batch render (see previous section)
5. Composite the _filtered image on top of the background image using whatever program you wish. We support After Effects in this class, so see the Compositing Lab for help with this.
-Note: If you did not check "denoise" in the render settings, you might only get a regular image (not _filtered)

Now you should be ready for and and all post production. Good job, you're almost done with your shorts!
