HEADING LARGE: INTRODUCTION

In this lab you'll learn how to animate a pendulum. To follow along, use <b>follow_along.mb</b>

When I say a pendulum I mean something like this: a base, and a chain that responds to the movements in the base.

This will allow us to practice overlapping action.


So lets say we have the following

How would the chain behave? Lets start with the top of the chain and work our way to the bottom.

HEADING LARGE: CREATING BELIEVABLE MOTIONS

As the platform moves left, the chain will actually rotate opposite the motion. In other words something like this:

But what about when the pendulum base slows down and stops. Well then we go to Newton. Objects in motion want to stay in motion so the pendulum will swing the opposite way. So we get something like this:

The chain will then continue to oscillate back and forth until the chain is out of energy.

Great. So now that we're done with the first link in the chain, it's time to do the rest of the links. 

We could go through and animate them by hand the same way we did the first one, but lets try to be more clever. Every successive link in the chain will just be doing what the previous link is doing but offset by some amount. So let's copy paste the curve from the first link into the second link.

Lets see what that looks like by hitting play.

HEADING LARGE: (DE)AMPLIFYING CURVES

To me, that looks a little too intense. Lets deamplify the second links rotation. I do this by selecting the curve and typing in *=.5 in the second stats box. *=.5 means "for all the selected keys, multiply their magnitude by .5. This deamps our curve by half.

Notice you can type in anything, it doesn't have to be .5. If you want your curve to be a quarter of it's former amplitude just type in .25. If you want to double the amplitude just type in 2.

This is what it looks like now.

HEADING LARGE: SHIFTING FRAMES

Notice however that right now we have a 1 to 1 relationship between the rotation in the first link and the second link. What I mean is that as the first link starts rotating clockwise, so does the second link. To create a more realistic flowing motion lets offset the rotation of the second link by a couple frames.

Notice that I shifted it over by 2 frames. But you can do as many or as little as you like based on what you're looking for. Less frames makes it more rigid, more frames makes it more flowy.

So now we have this.

Now lets repeat the process for the last link. In other words

1. Copy the previous links rotation into the new link.
2. Deamplify it in the new link if you think it's too big.
3. Shift it over by a couple frames

This is what my final version looks like.



HEADING LARGE: HOMEWORK

In pendulum_assignment.mb you'll find an already animated pendulum base.

Your job is to animate the chain below it. I'd approach this assignment by animating the first link of the pendulum for the whole scene and then just doing the copy paste deamplify offset procedure from up above.

If you're unsure about how a pendulum would move, I'd suggest checking out this video.
