HEADING LARGE: INTRODUCTION

Today we are going to be making blend shapes for a face. Before getting started, download this file to the scenes directory in your current Maya project:

FILE:faces.ma

HEADING LARGE: WHAT THE HECK ARE BLEND SHAPES?
Rigging a face can be difficult. Unlike legs, arms, and other body parts, joints do not map perfectly to the aspects of a face. Instead of joints, we use Maya blend shapes. Blend shapes take any number of different models and create a single model which can shift between any of the models in varying degrees.

For example, say we have two face models, one with an eyelid open and the other with an eyelid closed. A blend shape created with the two models will be able to open and close an eye. If you're confused, don't worry, blend shapes will make sense once you create your first one.

Most important rule of blend shapes: when you create your duplicates, do NOT add/remove faces, edges, or vertices! They all have to be the same exact number of faces, edges, and vertices for this to work.

Also, do NOT freeze transformations on the duplicates! Otherwise when your main model makes an expression as you move the slider, it'll also translate, which you do not want.

HEADING LARGE: CREATING A BLEND SHAPE
First, open up the faces.ma scene you downloaded in Maya. The scene consists of eleven models. The center model (selected below) is the neutral pose. Each one of the other model represents a specific facial expression on one side of the face:

The right side (relative to the image) of the face is smiling.

To create your blend shape, first select all the expression models (except the center, neutral expression). Make sure to select the neutral expression last. If this model isn't selected last, the blend shape won't work correctly.

With the models selected select Window → Animation Editors → Shape Editor.

Select “Create Blend Shape”. The window will populate with a number of sliders.

Center the screen on the middle face model (Select the model and press F). Play around with the newly-created sliders, sliding them up and down and back again. The face model should respond accordingly, closing its eyes, lowering its brow, and changing its mouth. Each slider controls the amount of blending between the base model and the targeted model. These sliders can be animated, a topic which will be covered later in the course.

After blend shape creation, hide all the models used to create your blend shape. Do not delete these models. After creating the blend shape, you may want to update one of these models later. If you delete the models, you will not be able to change your blend shape.
