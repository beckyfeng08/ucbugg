sorry, this sounds complicated because I am lazy and javascript sucks. It's pretty simple, just don't mess up

Images and attached files must be in a folder with the same name as the file inside the USER folder

LAB INSTRUCTIONS: 
	NAMING:
		1) make a file called labname.txt inside the USER folder
		2) "labname" must be a FULLY LOWERCASE EXACT MATCH of the UPPERCASE LAB NAME in the pipeline gui
			For example, basic modeling.txt, advanced rigging 2.txt, lighting.txt
		3) If you want to create a NEW lab, follow the same procedure, and also ADD THE NAME to labs.js
		4) DO NOT add pipeline categories without somebody who knows frontend, or else the page won't know where to draw the bubble

	FILES AND IMAGES
		make a folder called "labname" inside the USER folder, and put all images and files in there

	LAB.TXT FORMATTING
		Don't include a title (it will be auto-generated)

		Don't forget to check labs.js to make sure your lab is included

		to make a heading, use either
			HEADING LARGE:
			HEADING MEDIUM:
			HEADING SMALL:

		to insert an image, put the file name on its own line. line must end with .png, .jpg, or .gif
			(make sure the image is in the folder with the same name as the lab file name)

		to insert a non-image file (like a .ma file), do FILE: filename.

		to bold text, surround it with <b> </b> like this:
			I hope you remembered to <b> freeze transformations!!! </b>

		to italicize text, use <i> </i>

		to highlight text, use <mark> </mark>

		to strikethrough text, use <del> </del>
